# Steam-Game-Reviews
Use the Steam API to get information about PC games.  

This project is still in the early iterations.

It uses Express.js to create a backend server.

EJS templates are used to create dynamic pages.

Future implementations will feature Steam API integration, MongoDB, as well as accounts that users can create and use rate/review games.
